## Dataset Description
We obtained our dataset through the following link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date. The dataset, "NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date)", contains information about arrests made by the New York City Police Department. It comprises 63,621 entries, each representing an individual arrest record, distributed across 19 different columns that provide various details about each arrest.

Here is a breakdown of the columns and the types of data they contain:

1. **ARREST_KEY**: A unique identifier for each arrest (integer).
2. **ARREST_DATE**: The date on which the arrest was made (string, formatted as date).
3. **PD_CD** (Police Department Code): A numerical code representing the specific charge of the arrest (float).
4. **PD_DESC** (Police Department Description): A description of the charge (string).
5. **KY_CD** (Key Code): A numerical code categorizing the offense (float).
6. **OFNS_DESC** (Offense Description): A description of the offense category (string).
7. **LAW_CODE**: The specific law or statute under which the arrest was made (string).
8. **LAW_CAT_CD** (Law Category Code): The severity of the offense (e.g., felony, misdemeanor) (string).
9. **ARREST_BORO**: The borough in which the arrest occurred, denoted by a single letter (string).
10. **ARREST_PRECINCT**: The precinct number where the arrest occurred (integer).
11. **JURISDICTION_CODE**: A code indicating the jurisdiction responsible for the arrest (integer).
12. **AGE_GROUP**: Categorical age range of the arrestee (string).
13. **PERP_SEX**: Gender of the person arrested (string).
14. **PERP_RACE**: Race of the person arrested (string).
15. **X_COORD_CD** and **Y_COORD_CD**: Cartesian coordinates for mapping the event in the New York State Plane Coordinate System (integer).
16. **Latitude** and **Longitude**: Geographic coordinates of the arrest location (float).
17. **New Georeferenced Column**: A textual representation of the geographic location in a "POINT (longitude latitude)" format (string).

The dataset contains a mix of numeric and categorical data, providing a comprehensive view of the circumstances surrounding each arrest, including demographic data about the arrestees and specific details of the legal charges against them. This data can be used for statistical analysis to identify trends, assess law enforcement activity, and understand crime patterns in New York City.

## Research Questions

### Question #1: 
  What is the distribution of arrests across different boroughs of New York City for the age groups of <18 and 18-44, and what insights does this distribution provide into law enforcement practices, social demographics, and potential disparities?

#### Importance:
  The data obtained from this question can inform policymakers about the effectiveness and impact of law enforcement strategies. If there are significant differences in arrest rates among boroughs or age groups, it could prompt the need for policy changes or interventions to address underlying issues.

### Question #2: 
  What is the annual trend and distribution of robbery-related arrests throughout the year, and how do variations in arrest rates provide insights into patterns of criminal activity, law enforcement efforts, and potential factors influencing robbery incidents?

#### Importance:
  By examining the annual trend and distribution of robbery-related arrests, especially in correlation with retail sales data, researchers can discern if there are seasonal patterns in criminal activity. This can shed light on whether certain times of the year, such as the holiday season with higher retail sales, coincide with an increase in robbery incidents.
